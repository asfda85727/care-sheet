    <strong>Blue-Tongued Skink (Tiliqua scincoides intermedia)</strong>
    This care sheet applies specifically to the Northern blue-tongued skink,
    but most species and subspecies of blue-tongued skinks can be kept using these guidelines.
    Blue-tongued skinks are ideal for beginners, as they have loads of personality and great dispositions.
    Blue-tongued skinks are also an excellent choice for advanced hobbyists,
    as breeding them can be challenging and certain blue-tongue species and localities are extremely rare.

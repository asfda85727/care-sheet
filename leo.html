    <strong>Leopard Gecko (Eublepharis macularius)</strong>
    The leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) lizard has been captive bred in the United States for more than 30 years
    and is one of the most commonly kept lizards today. These hardy saurians come in a variety of colors,
    patterns and sizes. This is a great species for the home. Imagine a lizard that can vocalize
    and wash an eye with its tongue with ease. There is a friendly dinosaur in this small package.
